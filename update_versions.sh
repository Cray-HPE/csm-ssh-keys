# $CONFIGFILE is parsed from top to bottom. Whenever a line beginning with "targetfile:" is
# found, the file that follows has its version tags replaced with the actual version string.
# If not specified, the version tag and actual version source file take the default values
# specified above. They can be specified in the config file with "tag:" and "sourcefile:"
# lines. Such lines apply unless/until a later line overrides their values.
#
# Lines in the config file that do not begin with "sourcefile:", "tag:", or "targetfile:" are
# ignored.
